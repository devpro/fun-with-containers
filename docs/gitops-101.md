![h:400 center](./img/argocd.png)

Created in April 2022

## GitOps - What? (GitLab)

> GitOps is an **operational framework** that takes DevOps best practices used for application development such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD, and applies them to **infrastructure automation**.

→ [gitlab.com/gitops](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/)

---

## GitOps - What? (Red Hat)

> GitOps is a **set of practices** to manage infrastructure and application configurations using Git, an open source version control system.  
> GitOps works by using **Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications**.

## GitOps - When?

[![center](./img/Short-GitOps-Timeline-Light.png)](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/)

---

## GitOps - Why?

* Split application and infrastructure code
* Enable full automation from version control
* Simplify environment creation and configuration
* Apply people responsibility ("Dev", "Ops") to code management

---

## GitOps - How?

---- | ---------------| ---------
**CI/CD** | Technical | Continuous automation (pipelines)
**DevOps** | People | Collaboration practices
**GitOps** | Processes | Operational framework
**IaC** | Technical | Repositories with infrastructure code
